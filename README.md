# NanoWeather
A fun project for a handheld or ASCOM multisensor device for astronomy / astrophotography.
This project was developed during lockdown. This small box contains sensors to read sky quality (SQM), cloud cover, rain rate, pressure, humidity and temperature.

The electronics are pretty basic, but the assembly can be fiddly and uses the Arduino Nano board. The sensors are sensitive and it is best to keep power supplies clean and all connections as short 
as possible.
The unit works well and keeps calibration. The physicals of the assembly, circuit and hardware are in the wider details on the www.digitalastrophotography.co.uk website

The cloud cover calculation is derived from data from the web, Arduino libraries and practical measurement
